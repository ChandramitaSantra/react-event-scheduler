# React Event Scheduler App


Event Scheduler is a React app that allows users to create events. An event can be anything, such as a sport event, team meeting, party announcement, personal advertisement, etc. An event consists of title, start and end date/time, and description. Events can also be shared on FB or Twitter.
All events are public by default (visible to everyone). They can also be private (only visible to you) by checking the private checkbox.



## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React (react hooks)
- Typescript
- Bootstrap/react-bootstrap
- Styled components
- Apollo client
- JS cookie

### Backend

- NodeJS with Express
- Typescript
- Apollo server express
- JSON web token
- MongoDB with mongoose





## Run app locally

> Make sure MongoDB is up and running

In the project directory, run `yarn`, then:

### `yarn start`

Runs the backend and frontend apps simultaneously in the development mode.\

> Or if you prefer running the apps separately by running `start:web` and `start:server` in separate terminals.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
